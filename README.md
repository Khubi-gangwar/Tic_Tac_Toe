# Tic_Tac_Toe
This project is related to a game(Tic-Tac-Toe).............
"In the simple grid of lines and Xs, we find the joy of strategy and the thrill of the win."
"Tic Tac Toe — where childhood meets logic, and every move writes a tiny story of challenge and fun."
"Three in a row is more than a win; it’s a dance of minds on a 3x3 stage."
"A game so simple, yet every square holds endless possibilities."
"In Tic Tac Toe, even a draw teaches us the beauty of balance and patience."
"Sometimes, the smallest games hold the biggest lessons in planning, predicting, and playing fair."
